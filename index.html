    <h2>Welding Certifications</h2>
    <p>Welding certifications are valuable credentials that validate the skills and knowledge of welders in various industries. These certifications provide assurance to employers and clients that a welder has met specific industry standards and possesses the necessary expertise to perform high-quality welds. Here are some key aspects to know about welding certifications:</p>

    <h3>1. Certification Bodies</h3>
    <p>Certifications are typically issued by recognized organizations such as the American Welding Society (AWS), the International Institute of Welding (IIW), or specific regulatory bodies in different countries. These organizations establish standards and guidelines for certification programs.</p>

    <h3>2. Types of Certifications</h3>
    <p>There are multiple types of welding certifications, depending on the specific welding process, materials, and positions being tested. Some common certifications include Certified Welding Inspector (CWI), Certified Welding Educator (CWE), Certified Welding Supervisor (CWS), and various welder performance qualifications.</p>

    <h3>3. Welder Performance Qualifications</h3>
    <p>Welder performance qualifications, commonly known as "welder certifications," are specific to individual welders. These certifications indicate their ability to produce quality welds as per established codes and standards. They involve testing the welder's skills through practical examinations, often conducted by certified welding inspectors or examiners.</p>

    <h3>4. Certification Tests</h3>
    <p>Certification tests evaluate a welder's abilities in specific welding processes and positions. These tests typically involve visual inspection of welds, destructive testing of samples, and assessments based on applicable codes and procedures. Welders need to demonstrate their competency in producing welds that meet the specified requirements for factors like soundness, strength, and appearance.</p>

    <h3>5. Codes and Standards</h3>
    <p>Certifications are often based on specific codes and standards relevant to the industry or application. These codes outline welding techniques, materials, quality control measures, and safety requirements. Some widely recognized codes include AWS D1.1 (structural welding), ASME Section IX (pressure vessels and boilers), and API 1104 (pipeline welding).</p>

    <h3>6. Recertification</h3>
    <p>Welding certifications are typically valid for a certain period, ranging from six months to several years, depending on the certification and requirements set by the certifying body. To maintain certification, welders may need to periodically undergo recertification tests to ensure their skills and knowledge are up to date.</p>

    <h3>7. Industry Acceptance</h3>
    <p>Different industries have varying requirements and preferences for welding certifications. Some sectors, such as construction, manufacturing, and aerospace, tend to place significant emphasis on certified welders. Knowing the specific certification requirements of the industry you wish to work in can provide a competitive advantage when seeking employment.</p>

    <p>Obtaining welding certifications demonstrates a commitment to professionalism, quality, and safety in the welding trade. These credentials can help welders secure better job opportunities, negotiate higher wages, and earn the trust of clients and employers. They also encourage ongoing skill development and knowledge enhancement within the welding field.</p>

  <h2>What are welding symbols?</h2>
  
  <p>Welding symbols are the written language of welders. They are how engineers describe exactly how a part is to be welded. They describe the joint preparation, the weld size, the finishing method and, any other requirements according to the project or standard being adhered to. They are capable of describing NDT methods as well as welding process to be used.</p>
  
  <p>It is imperative that welders understand them. It was my experience during the hiring process that there isn't very many ways to test a welder's knowledge of symbols, so I devized this symbol test to solve this problem. Generally, what I would do is give them this test to take while I prepare the machine for their test (I always zero out their machine first but that's a topic for another article).</p>

      <h2>An oversimplified walk-through on creating a WPS (Welding Procedure Specification)</h2>
    <p>By: Justin Bryan</p>
    <p>To those who have never done it, writing a code compliant WPS seems like a daunting task. Truth be told your first one probably will be. My goal here is to ease some of that pain.</p>

    <h3>What is a WPS?</h2>
    <p>A welding Procedure specification is just a document with a range of variables designed to create successful welds repeatedly. The point is, so that we can have multiple welders weld the same way. As a welder the WPS is the law. It is the set of rules we follow. We take welding variables from pre-qualified or qualified data (see below), and expand them to fit a reasonable range of applications but within parameters of change layed out by whatever standard we are fabricating to.</p>

    <h3>Pre Qualified vs Qualified</h2>
    <p>Prequalified WPS's do not require any testing (though it won't hurt). The data required to write them is included in the code. Qualified WPS's get the data they are based on, from a document called a PQR (procedure qualification record). A PQR is a record of testing done to a sample of a weldment to prove that the variables being used can produce a weld with the desired attributes.</p>

    <h3>Essential variables</h2>
    <p>Once we have this data we need to parse through what our code considers "essential". In the case of AWS D1.1 its pretty simple because it is layed out in a table. The main takeaway here is that, everything that our code deems "essential" is on our procedure, and that the values are within the parameters set out by the code.</p>
    <h3>Helpful tips</h2>
    <p>Make it with as wide of a scopescope as possible. Make it easy to read. Make it short, no more then two pages. I will be releasing templates in excel format that will save you hours of time because you will only have to change or add a few essential variables (depending on the code) and just fill in the blanks.
